This is a simple HTML/CSS Project and its purpose is to practice my Web Design skills.

Useful Tips: 

I. Website Personalities
  1) Serious/Elegant -  for luxury and elegance, based on thin serif typefaces, golden or pastel colors, and big high-quality images;
  2) Minimalist/Simple -  focusses on the essential text content, using small or medium-sized sans-serif black text, lines, and few images and icons;
  3) Plain/Neutral -  design that gets out of the way by using neutral and small typefaces, and a very structured layout. Common in big corporations;
  4) Bold/Confident -  makes an impact, by featuring big and bold typography, paired with confident use of big and bright colored blocks;
  5) Calm/Peaceful -  for products and services that care, transmitted by calming pastel colors, soft serif headings, and matching images/illustrations;
  6) Startup/Upbeat - widely used in startups, featuring medium-sized sans-serif typefaces, light-grey text and backgrounds, and rounded elements;
  7) Playful/Fun - colorful and round designs, fueled by creative elements like hand-drawn icons or illustrations, animations, and fun language;

II. Typography
  1) Use only good and popular typefaces and play it safe;
    1.1) sans-serif - Modern look and feel; Clean and simple; Good for beginners;
         Example Fonts: Inter, Open Sans, Roboto, Montserrat, Work Sans, Lato;
    1.2) serif - Traditional/classic look and feel; Conveys trustworthiness; Good for long text;
         Example Fonts: Merriweather, Aleo, Playfair Display, Cormorant, Cardo, Lora;
  2) Use 1 to 2 typefaces per page;
  3) Choose the right typeface according to the website personality:
     3.1) Choose the right personality;
     3.2) Decide between serif and sans-serif typeface;
     3.3) Experiment with all the "good" typefaces; 
  4) Font size system (px): 10 / 12 / 14 / 16 / 18 / 20 / 24 / 30 / 36 / 44 / 52 / 62 / 74 / 86 / 98;
  5) Normal text size: between 16 and 32px;
  6) Long text (like a blog post): 20px or bigger;
  7) Headlines: 50px+ and bold (600+) depending on personality;
  8) Don't use font weight lower than 400 (regular);
  9) Use less than 75 characters per line;
  10) For normal-sized text, use a line-height between 1.5 and 2. For big text - below 1.5 (like 1.1 or 1.2);
  11) Decrease the letter spacing in headlines, if it looks unnatural;
  12) For short titles - experiment with all caps; small, bold and increased letter spacing;
  13) Don't justify the text;
  14) Don't center long text blocks (smalls are fine);
  15) Tools: Google Fonts, Font Squirrel, Type Scale - https://type-scale.com/;
 
 III. Colors
  1) Make the main color match the website personality;
    1.1) Red - draws a lot of attention; symbolizes power, passion and excitement;
    1.2) Orange - less aggressive; conveys happiness, cheerfulness and creativity;
    1.3) Yellow - means joy, brightness and intelligence;
    1.4) Green - represents harmony, nature, growth and health;
    1.5) Blue - associated with peace, trustworthiness and professionalism;
    1.6) Purple - conveys wealth, wisdom and magic;
    1.7) Pink - represents romance, care and affection;
    1.8) Brown - associated with nature, durability and comfort;
    1.9) Black - symbolizes power, elegance and minimalism, but also grief and sorrow.
  2) Use a good color tone! Don't choose a random tone or CSS named colors;
    2.1) OpenColor - https://yeun.github.io/open-color/
    2.2) Tailwind CSS;
    2.3) Flat UI Colors 2;
  3) We need at least 2 types of colors - main color and grey color;
  4) With more experience, add more colors (secondary color);
  5) Create lighter and darker versions of the picked colors (tints and shades);
    5.1) Coolors; 
    5.2) palleton.com;
    5.3) Tint & Shade Generator;
  6) Main color draws attention to the most important elements on the page (buttons, logos, etc.);
  7) Use colors to add interesting accents or make entire components or sections stand out;
  8) Try to use the colors strategically with images and illustrations;
  9) On dark colored backgrounds - use a tint of the background (lighter version) for the text;
  10) Text shouldn't be completely black - it looks heavy and uninviting (gray instead);
  11) Don't make text too light! Use tool to check contrast between text and background colors (4:5:1 for normal and 3:1 for large text):
    11.1) Coolors;
